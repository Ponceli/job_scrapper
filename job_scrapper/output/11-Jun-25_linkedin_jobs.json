Regardless of the model, we believe in recruiting the best available talent available in the market, and offer our customers great value for their money.

Vacation and Sick Leave credits: Enjoy vacation and sick leave credits to maintain work-life balance.  Health Coverage: Get medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.
